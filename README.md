# r_selfenc

Create a self-decrypting file for R using AES symmetric encryption. This one single R source file generated by _r_selfenc_ stores encrypted data and the function to decrypt it's data.  

## Quick start

### Encrypt

Source `main.R` and call `encrypt_to_source(...)` with some objects to produce a self-encrypted R file.

### Decrypt

Decryption is done by typing a single command in R. Just source the self-encrypted R file from an interactive R session (will prompt for the password).

Example `souce("my_encrypted_sensitive_data.R")`

## Requirements

 * digest package

## TODO

 * change ECB to CBC
 * check if decryption was successful
